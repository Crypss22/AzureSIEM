<h1>Azure Honeypot</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project consisted of making a SIEM through Microsoft's cloud platform, Azure. Through my vulnerable honeypot, I was able to capture brute-force attacks onto my Virtual Machine and aggregate them through log analytics and plot them through geolocation onto a visual map.
Below I included screenshots with explanations of the steps conducted.
